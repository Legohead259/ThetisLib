- Major refactor

### Added
- Certain telemetry can now be dynamically logged using compiler build flags
- Added GPS timestamp segments to the data structure
- Added `initSPIFFS()` function to filesystem
- Added a `fusion` file to handle the IMU sensor fusion and filtering
- Added several dependency libraries
- Added `data.cpp` source file

### Changed
- Changed type of `state` parameter in the telemetry data structure to `uint8_t` to remove cyclic dependency. `status_t` can be cast to `uint8_t`
- Renamed the data structure from `telemetry` to `data` to better reflect its use in the code
- Migrated all time stamping functions in `logging`
- Changed the return type of `initNeoPixel()` to `bool` for consistency. **NOTE**: This only returns true, in the future we should change it so that it can detect when the NEOPIXEL_EN gate is open
- Moved all sensor fusion functions from `lsm6dso32` to `fusion` to make future development easier
- Changed declaration of `data` to fix memory addressing error

### Removed
