---

## [UNRELEASED] 1.5.1 - 2022-12-27

---

## 1.5.0 - 2022-12-25

---

## 1.4.0 - 2022-11-23

### Added
- Added a massive rework to the logging system
  - Added seven different logging levels that can be used to track events
- Consolidated all logging functions into an object-oriented approach, allowing more flexibility
- Loggers can specify which streams they send data to and what the information looks like
- Ability to dynamically switch between streaming the event log to the Serial monitor or the file system, depending on USB connection
- Expanded the configuration options that can be saved to SPIFFS
  - Log level for print streaming
  - Log level for event file
- Added various `info`, `fatal`, and `verbose` statements throughout code to track flow

### Changed
- Changed static logging behavior to object-oriented
- Moved `fusion.h` to `AHRS/` folder since that makes more sense
- Removed state update behavior in `updateSystemState()`, for now

### Deprecated
- Deprecated the old `logging` files - they currently have the file extension `.bkp` for safekeeping - remove in next update!

### Removed
- Removed BNO055 files
  
---

## 1.3.0 - 2022-11-20 

### Added
- Added `pollGPS()` function
- Added raw IMU readings to logging functions
- Added raw IMU readings to data packet
- Added a function to log data to the file in a binary format
- Added an `updateTimestamp()` function to update the data packet epoch
- Added ability to change IMU information from configuration data
- Added ability to change sensor fusion update rate from configuration data
- Expanded the configuration options that can be saved to SPIFFS
  - More device information
  - WiFi information
  - Sensor information
  - Logging information

### Changed
- Changed log file extension to 'bin' instead of 'csv'
- Changed configuration parsing behavior to be more efficient to add new parameters
- Changed `configData` structure to reflect to configuration options
- Changed some names in `configData` structure

### Fixed
- Fixed minor typos throughout

### Deprecated
- Deprecated all human-readable logging functions

## 1.2.0 - 2022-10-06
- Major refactor

### Added
- Certain telemetry can now be dynamically logged using compiler build flags
- Added GPS timestamp segments to the data structure
- Added `initSPIFFS()` function to filesystem
- Added a `fusion` file to handle the IMU sensor fusion and filtering
- Added several dependency libraries
- Added `data.cpp` source file

### Changed
- Changed type of `state` parameter in the telemetry data structure to `uint8_t` to remove cyclic dependency. `status_t` can be cast to `uint8_t`
- Renamed the data structure from `telemetry` to `data` to better reflect its use in the code
- Migrated all time stamping functions in `logging`
- Changed the return type of `initNeoPixel()` to `bool` for consistency. **NOTE**: This only returns true, in the future we should change it so that it can detect when the NEOPIXEL_EN gate is open
- Moved all sensor fusion functions from `lsm6dso32` to `fusion` to make future development easier
- Changed declaration of `data` to fix memory addressing error

### Removed
- Removed the `packetSize` parameter from the telemetry data structure. This can be replaced by `sizeof(data)` in practice.
- Removed the Kalman filter files since they are being replaced by the proper Kalman library downloaded from PIO
- Removed MicroNMEA library since it is now a downloadable dependency
- Removed `gps_enable` parameter from the configuration data structure
---

## 1.1.6 - 2022-07-29
